## Token Swap Smart Contract

A solidity smart contract to facilitate swapping of one ERC-20 token for another at a 
predefined exchange rate. The contract consists of the following features:
- Users can swap Token A for Token B and vice versa.
- The exchange rate between Token A and Token B is fixed.
- The swap will always adhere to the exchange rate.


The contract is tested using the *Foundry Framework*.
Check the test/ folder for more details.

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
